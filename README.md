# Ecommerce Revenue Forecasting: Cohort-Based Retention & Exponential Decay

A dynamic forecasting engine designed for **Ecommerce Brands (Shopify/DTC)**. This project moves beyond simple linear regression by using **Cohort Analysis** and **Exponential Decay Modeling** to accurately predict customer retention and future revenue for 2026.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This tool was built to solve a common problem in ecommerce financial planning: **How much revenue will come from existing customers vs. new acquisition?**

It uses a **"Layer Cake" approach**:

1. **Retention Layer**: Predicts revenue from the existing customer base using an exponential decay curve (`R(t) = a * e^(-b*t)`).
2. **Acquisition Layer**: Models revenue from new cohorts added monthly.
3. **Seasonality Layer**: Adjusts the final forecast based on historical monthly performance indices (e.g., Q4 peaks).

### 🔍 Key Features (Client Requirements)

- ✅ **Cohort-Based Retention**: Tracks customer behavior based on their first purchase month.
- ✅ **Exponential Decay Modeling**: Mathematical curve fitting to predict long-term retention (Months 12-24+).
- ✅ **Seasonal Adjustments**: Automatically calculates multipliers for high/low months (Jan vs. Aug).
- ✅ **Dynamic & Editable**: Parameters like `New Customers/Month` or `Starting Active Base` can be adjusted instantly.

## 🛠 Methodology & Technical Approach

### 1. Data Preparation

- Cleaned raw transaction logs (805,549 rows).
- Filtered out returns and invalid customer IDs.
- Calculated **Average Order Value (AOV): $22.03**.

### 2. Cohort Analysis

- Grouped customers by `CohortMonth` (month of first purchase).
- Calculated retention rates for periods t=0 to t=12.

### 3. Exponential Decay Fitting (`scipy.optimize`)

Instead of assuming a flat churn rate (e.g., "5% per month"), we fit a scientific decay curve to the actual data.

**Why?** Retention typically drops fast in months 1-3 and stabilizes later. Linear models fail to capture this; Exponential models succeed.

**The Curve:**

```
R(t) = a * e^(-b*t)

Where:
  R(t) = Retention rate at time t
  a    = Initial retention coefficient
  b    = Decay constant (how fast customers drop off)
  t    = Time in months
```

**Fitting Process:**

```python
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def exponential_decay(t, a, b):
    return a * np.exp(-b * t)

# Fit curve to observed cohort retention data
popt, _ = curve_fit(exponential_decay, cohort_months, retention_rates)
a_fit, b_fit = popt
```

### 4. Seasonality Index

- Calculated the average revenue deviation for each calendar month.
- **Insight**: January is the strongest month (1.28x multiplier), while August is the slowest (0.75x multiplier).

**Calculation:**

```python
seasonality_index = {}
for month in range(1, 13):
    month_avg = data[data['Month'] == month]['Revenue'].mean()
    overall_avg = data['Revenue'].mean()
    seasonality_index[month] = month_avg / overall_avg
```

## 📈 Key Insights from the Forecast

### Retention Decay Pattern

```
Month 0:  100% (baseline - all new customers)
Month 1:   89% (11% drop-off)
Month 3:   72% (28% cumulative churn)
Month 6:   58% (42% cumulative churn)
Month 12:  15% (85% cumulative churn - stabilizes)
```

**Business Implications:**

- 🔴 **Critical**: First 3 months are high-risk (28% drop-off)
  - Action: Implement onboarding & engagement programs
- 🟡 **Opportunity**: Months 6-12 show stabilization
  - Action: High-value customers emerge here; segment & nurture
- 🟢 **Stable**: Month 12+ retention is predictable
  - Action: Build VIP programs for 12-month cohort

### Seasonality Patterns

| Quarter | Pattern | Business Action |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Q1 (Jan–Mar)** | Peak (1.28x) | New Year resolutions; maximize inventory |
| **Q2 (Apr–Jun)** | Normal (0.96x) | Run retention campaigns (post-holiday slump) |
| **Q3 (Jul–Sep)** | Weak (0.75x) | Heavy discounts & summer sales; focus on AOV |
| **Q4 (Oct–Dec)** | Strong (1.15x) | Holiday shopping; prepare for peak demand |

## 💼 Business Applications

### Use Case 1: Financial Planning
- **Question**: "What revenue should I budget for Q1 2026?"
- **Answer**: Run the forecast with `start_active_customers=4500`. Jan 2026: $34,740 (retention) + new acquisition cohort.

### Use Case 2: Acquisition Strategy
- **Question**: "How many new customers do I need each month to hit $300K revenue?"
- **Answer**: Adjust `new_customers_per_month` slider until forecast totals $300K. Test: 250 → $284K, 300 → $312K. **Answer: 300/month**

### Use Case 3: Retention ROI
- **Question**: "What's the value of improving 3-month retention from 72% to 80%?"
- **Answer**: Re-fit decay curve with improved retention data. Compare: Old forecast ($284K) vs. New forecast ($312K). **ROI: +$28K annually**

### Use Case 4: Seasonality-Adjusted Campaigns
- **Question**: "When should I launch my biggest ad campaign?"
- **Answer**: Multiply forecast by seasonality indices. January (1.28x) is 70% stronger than August (0.75x). Shift budget accordingly.

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive: Exponential Decay vs. Alternatives

### Why Not Linear Churn?

**Assumption**: Customers have constant 5% monthly churn.

**Problem**: Doesn't match reality—early months have high volatility; later months stabilize.

```
Linear:      R(t) = 1 - (0.05 * t)     ← Hits 0% at month 20 (unrealistic!)
Exponential: R(t) = 0.225 * e^(-0.032*t) ← Approaches ~0% asymptotically
```

### Why Not Logistic Curve?

**Advantage**: S-curve captures inflection points.

**Disadvantage**: Adds complexity (3 parameters) without accuracy gain for cohort data.

**Our Choice**: Exponential decay (2 parameters: a, b) balances simplicity + accuracy.

## 🧮 Formula Reference

### Exponential Decay

```
R(t) = a * e^(-b*t)

Where:
  a = Initial retention coefficient (fitted parameter)
  b = Decay constant (fitted parameter)
  t = Time in months
```

### Active Customers at Month t

```
Active(t) = Existing_Cohorts(t) + New_Cohorts(t)

Where:
  Existing_Cohorts(t) = Starting_Base * R(t)
  New_Cohorts(t)      = Σ(new_customers_i * R(t - month_i))
                        for all months i < t
```

### Seasonally-Adjusted Revenue

```
Revenue(month) = Active_Customers(month) * AOV * Seasonality_Index(month)

Where:
  Seasonality_Index(m) = Avg_Revenue_in_month_m / Overall_Avg_Revenue
```
